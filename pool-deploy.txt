steps:

1. Deploy new pool
   * function: deploy()
   * note that salt is a 64 character hex string
        xxd -l32 -c 32 -ps /dev/random
   * take rate is scaled to 7 decimals, so 20% = 2000000

   example:
    GDJS...P6OL invoked contract ￼CBNG...EZDK deploy(￼GDJS...P6OL, "Sveiks"str, msepzeI6wq2hEQXuqkLkPC6oMyygqo9B9Y1xYCdNcY4=bytes, ￼CAVL...6HLP, 20u32, 4u32) -> ￼CCEY...GGL7 

1a. Deposit backstop tokens
   * function: deposit()
   * this might not be required, but can help the UI to not error out in some cases
   * contract address is the backstop contract
        CDJQJS3TLZ6LEWSBOZ2E6QEZZ4NS3JU5LDT2BT7A4UHWAXPLSNE6MM37 (testnet)


2. Queue Set Reserve (for each asset)
   * contract ID needs to be set to the output of deployment (CCEY... in the example)
   * function queue_set_reserve()
   * assets ->
         CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC (XLM testnet)
         CAP5AMC2OHNVREO66DFIN6DHJMPOBAJ2KCDDIMFBR7WWJH5RZBFM3UEI (wBTC testnet)
         CAZAQB3D7KSLSNOSQKYD2V4JP5V2Y3B4RDJZRLBFCCIXDCTE3WHSY3UE (wETH testnet)
         CAQCFVLOBK5GIULPNZRGATJJMIZL5BSP7X5YJVMGCPTUEPFM4AVSRCJU (USDC testnet)
   * metadata ->
        index: 0
        decimals: 7
        c_factor:  8000000  = 0.80
        l_factor:  8000000  = 0.80
        util:      6000000  = 0.60  # util must be < max_util
        max_util:  7000000  = 0.70
        r_base:     100000  = 0.01
        r_one:      500000  = 0.05
        r_two:      500000  = 0.05
        r_three:  50000000  = 5.00
        react:          20  = 0.000002

3. Call set reserve (for each asset)
   * function set_reserve()
   * asset list is the same as in step 2
   * make note of the index returned from each call, as this is the res_index
   * NOTE: you can call set_reserve() after each queue_set_reserve() call 
     if you want.

4. Set pool emissions
   * function set_emissions_config()
   * vector -> [ 
        res_index: 0
        res_type: 0
        share: 1000000 = 10%
    ] etc...

5. Activate
   * function: set_status()
   * 0 = active, 2 = on ice, 4 = frozen
   * status should be set to "on ice" first to allow deposits, then
     updated to "active" once the threshold is met.
   * IMPORTANT NOTE: that there is a hard-coded backstop threshold of
     200k product constant.  The exact amount of shares varies depending
     on value, but is roughly:
        x = blend amount for 1 LP share
        y = usdc amount for 1 LP share
        k = x^0.8 * y^0.8

     At present 1 share equals 4.9158 BLND and 0.0555 USDC, so 1 share = 
        4.9158^0.8 * 0.0555^0.2 = 2.005090414527

     To meet the 200k threshold, you'd need about 99.8k LP shares in
     the backstop.

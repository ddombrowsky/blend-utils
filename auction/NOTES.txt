## automated auction bot

source:
    https://github.com/script3/auctioneer-bot

docker:
    docker pull script3/auctioneer-bot:latest

config.json:
* `defaultProfitPct` is from 0.00 to 1.00, 0.1 = 10%.
* `minHealthFactor` 0 to inf, 1.1=110%.  Equal to collateral / liabilities.
  Note that this the HF for the _bidding_ bot.  The collateral and liabilities are
  transfered directly to the bidding bot, so the HF of the bot's account
  needs to be high enough to handle that.  That means it should already have significant
  collateral in the bank.  The HF is calculated including the fillers existing deposits.
* example (v1):

In the UI, the "auctions" tab will list the final value the auction was filled at.

## blend bot

This is similar to, but not the same as, the script3 auction bot.
Noted here only for reference.  I had better luck with the auction bot.

Listen for events on the pool contract to know when it's starting.

## local RPC

It is possible to run the auction bot against a public RPC like
`soroban-rpc.creit.tech`, but you will quickly run into rate limiting
issues.  

NOTE: The consensus node configurations can be found from stellarbeat.io.
For example, see 
https://stellarbeat.io/nodes/GCGB2S2KGYARPVIA37HYZXVRM2YZUEXA6S33ZU5BUDC6THSB62LZSTYH?center=1
and click "stellar core config".  This will show the URLs and the public key.
